      <p>I love you sayang. You're my favourite person in this whole wide world. Thank you for always having my back and being by my side.
      I'm sorry for always acting out, getting mad, being rude to you. I don't mean any harm at all. I love you a lot after all.
      Sometimes I just don't know why I'm acting this way. I feel bad for ever giving you a hard time. I don't like hogging all of your
      time either. But I'm sorry I'm just so lonely and you seem to be the only thing that's keeping me going these days. I can't seem to
      get anything done without you. You're my biggest source of comfort and I love you very much. I can't wait to see us grow together.
      Keep being the most cool and amazing and talented person you are. I wish we could build more and more fun memories ahead.
      Keep doing you, and you know I'll always always support your dreams. And here's to many more years ahead with you Harris.
      Happy Birthday Sayang! </p>
